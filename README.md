## 🎯 Overview

Ms. Ghostman is a single-player arcade game with a Pac-Man-first loop and Bomberman-style bomb mechanics:

- **Pac-Man**: Navigate a grid-based maze, eat all pellets to complete a level.
- **Bomberman**: Drop bombs to destroy walls, create paths, and eliminate enemies.

The result is a strategic game where every move matters. Block off ghost routes, set bomb traps, chain explosions, and race against the clock.

### 🧠 What Is ECS?

**ECS** means **Entity-Component-System**:

- **Entity**: a simple numeric ID (for example, player, ghost, bomb).
- **Component**: pure data attached to entities (position, velocity, bomb fuse, score tags).
- **System**: logic that reads/writes component data in deterministic order (movement, AI, collisions, rendering).

Why this project uses ECS: it keeps gameplay logic modular, deterministic, and fast enough for stable 60 FPS DOM rendering.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🕹️ **Hold-to-move controls** — smooth, responsive keyboard input processed via input systems.
- 💣 **Bomb mechanics** — 3-second fuse, cross-shaped explosions, chain reactions.
- 👻 **4 unique ghost personalities** — from aggressive to unpredictable.
- ⚡ **Power-ups** — increased bomb range, extra bombs, speed boosts, ghost-stunning pellets.
- ⏱️ **Countdown timer** — beat the clock for bonus points.
- 🏆 **Scoring & combos** — chain-kill ghosts for exponential bonuses.
- ⏸️ **Pause menu** — continue or restart without losing progress.
- 📊 **3 difficulty levels** — increasing maze density, ghost count, and speed.
- 🎨 **60 FPS DOM rendering** — no canvas, pure CSS Grid + transform animations via a dedicated Render Batcher.

### 🧩 Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | An opaque numeric ID. Contains no behavior or methods. |
| **Component** | Data-only records (POJOs) attached to entities. No DOM references. |
| **System** | Dedicated functions that query components and mutate state in a fixed order. |
| **World** | Owners of entities and systems. Orchestrates frame execution and resource access. |
| **Query** | High-performance filters that retrieve entities matching specific component masks. |

## ⚙️ Frame Pipeline

1. **rAF Start**: `requestAnimationFrame` initiates the frame.
2. **Input Sync**: Input adapter snapshots key states into world resources.
3. **Simulation (Fixed-Step)**:
    - Input systems apply intents to components.
    - Movement and AI systems update positions and states.
    - Bomb and explosion systems process fuses and chain reactions.
    - Collision and scoring systems resolve overlaps and points.
    - Timer systems handle level countdowns and transitions.
4. **Visual Pre-processing**: Render collect system computes transform intents based on interpolation.
5. **DOM Commit**: Render DOM system applies a single batched style-write phase.
6. **HUD Update**: HUD adapter updates text metrics using `textContent` only.

### ⏸️ Pause Behavior
- `requestAnimationFrame` continues running to keep menus responsive.
- Simulation update steps are skipped when the pause flag is active.

### 🔒 2026 Runtime Contract
- Fixed-step simulation uses an accumulator with bounded catch-up (`maxStepsPerFrame`).
- `frameTime` is clamped before accumulator integration to avoid spiral-of-death bursts after stalls.
- Input is tracked as hold-state and consumed from deterministic per-step snapshots.
- On resume from pause or tab restore, timing baselines are re-synchronized before simulation continues.

## 🚀 Rendering & Performance Targets

### 🎨 DOM Strategy
- **Static Grid**: Persistent board elements created once at startup.
- **Node Pooling**: Transient entities (bombs, fire, effects) use recycled DOM nodes. Prevent GC pauses.
- **Compositor Friendly**: All movement updates restricted to `transform` and `opacity`.
- **Minimal Jank**: Strict avoidance of layout thrashing through batched read/write phases.

### ⚡ Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Frame rate | ≥ 60 FPS target with no sustained dropped-frame bursts |
| Frame budget | p95 <= 16.7ms over representative 60s scenarios |
| DOM elements | ≤ 500 |
| Layer count | 3-5 composited layers |
| GC pauses | < 1ms (object pooling, in-place component mutation) |
| JS heap | < 10MB |
| Layout thrashing | Zero (batch reads → writes via `render-dom-system.js`) |

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

| Layer | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Unit Tests** | Pure systems tested with seeded RNG and deterministic clocks via Vitest. No DOM required. |
| **Integration** | World scheduling and cross-system interaction (e.g., bomb chains, pause logic, respawns). |
| **Adapter Tests** | Verification of input normalization and DOM write batching outputs natively. |
| **Determinism** | Comparison of final state hashes across identical seed/input traces. |
| **Pause Invariants** | While paused, simulation state is frozen and rAF-driven UI remains responsive. |
| **Performance** | Profile-backed checks for frame-time percentiles, long tasks, layout/paint stability, and allocation behavior. |
| **Accessibility** | Keyboard navigation, pause-menu focus management, and meaningful HUD status updates. |

### 🗂️ Test Suite Structure

```

### ✅ Audit Coverage Requirement

- The `tests/e2e/audit/audit.e2e.test.js` suite is mapped directly to `docs/audit.md`.
- Verification follows `AGENTS.md` test categories:
    - Fully Automatable: `F-01..F-16`, `B-01`, `B-02`, `B-03`
    - Semi-Automatable: `F-17`, `F-18`
    - Manual-With-Evidence: `F-19`, `F-20`, `F-21`, `B-04`, `B-05`, `B-06`
- The project is complete only when all mapped automated checks pass and required manual evidence artifacts are attached.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Constraints

### Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **JavaScript (ES2026)** | Game logic, DOM manipulation |
| **HTML5** | Semantic page structure |
| **CSS3** | Grid layout, animations, styling |
| **Vite** | Dev server, bundler |
| **Biome** | Linting + formatting |
| **Vitest** | Unit testing |

### Explicitly NOT Used (by requirement)

| Technology | Reason |
|---|---|
| `<canvas>` | Project requirement — DOM/SVG only |
| React / Vue / Angular | No frameworks allowed |
| Game engines (Phaser, etc.) | Must build custom ECS engine |

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for ECS coding standards and constraints.
2. Read [docs/implementation/agentic-workflow-guide.md](docs/implementation/agentic-workflow-guide.md) for the 4-dev agent workflow, PR gates, and security checklist.
3. Review `docs/implementation/implementation-plan.md` and the corresponding `docs/implementation/track-*.md` file for your specific track assignment.
4. Feature branches should isolate specific ECS systems or component additions.
5. Core systems MUST remain pure functions handling data components; systems MUST access adapters via World resources and MUST NOT import adapters directly (including `render-dom-system.js`).
6. Run `npm run check && npm run test` before committing.
7. CI MUST pass all merge gates (schema validation, testing, lockfile integrity, policy gate) before merge. When coverage/SBOM scripts are configured, those gates MUST also pass.
8. The policy gate workflow enforces PR review, audit alignment, security boundaries, and dependency pairing.
9. Request review at integration milestones.
